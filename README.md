Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I create a visualization dashboard website (https://nnorman312.github.io/WebVisualizations/index.html) using visualizations from my python-api-challenge repository where I addressed a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

In building this dashboard, I create individual pages for each plot: Latitude vs. Temperature (F), Latitude vs. Humidity (%), Latitude vs. Cloudiness (%), and Latitude vs. Wind Speed (mph). 

I include a means by which to navigate between the different pages. These pages also contain visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also create a landing page, a page to compare all of the plots, and another page that includes the data used to build them.
